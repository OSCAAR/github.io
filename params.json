{"name":"oscaar","tagline":"Open Source Code Differential Photometry for Advancing Amateur Reseach","body":"oscaar is a differential photometry toolkit for everyone! Written in Python, this project is meant to serve as an \"out-of-the-box\" photometry code for amateurs OR a scaffolding on which professional astronomers can develop robust photometry tools. It's built to be as modular and flexible as possible to make it easy to adapt to your data, wherever it came from.\r\n\r\noscaar is currently in active development and may currently break at any time -- the stable v2.0 release is expected early in the summer of 2013.\r\n\r\n## System Requirements\r\nIn order to keep oscaar free and accessible, we've built it on the shoulders of giants in the Python community. The modules \r\n\r\n**Supported Operating Systems**\r\n* Mac OS 10.6, 10.7 and 10.8 (with caveats)\r\n* Windows Vista and later\r\n* Ubuntu 12.04 and later\r\n\r\n**Things to download**\r\n* **[Python 2.7.x](http://www.python.org/download/)**\r\n* **[NumPy and SciPy](http://scipy.org/Download)**: Python modules for scientific computing\r\n* **[PyFITS 2.4.0](http://www.stsci.edu/institute/software_hardware/pyfits/Download)**: A Python module for FITS handling\r\n* **[matplotlib](http://matplotlib.org/downloads.html)**: A Python module for plotting your results\r\n* **[wxPython](http://wxpython.org/download.php)**: A GUI toolkit that allows you to press buttons rather than manipulate the code from the command line (...unless you want to!)\r\n\r\n_Optional_\r\n* **[PyEphem 3.7.5](http://rhodesmill.org/pyephem/)**: A Python module providing astronomical calculations within Python","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
